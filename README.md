# PLP Academy Python Assignment - Week 5

This repository contains the Python assignment for Week 5 of the PLP Academy. The focus of this assignment is to demonstrate **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts such as **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **encapsulation**.

## Overview

The project includes a Python program that demonstrates OOP principles using a `Vehicle` class and its subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`). Each subclass overrides the `move()` method to showcase **polymorphism**. The program also includes an example usage section to demonstrate how the classes interact.

---

## Features

- **Base Class**: `Vehicle` serves as the base class with a placeholder `move()` method.
- **Inheritance**: Subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`) inherit from the `Vehicle` class.
- **Polymorphism**: Each subclass implements its own version of the `move()` method.
- **Encapsulation**: Demonstrated through the structure of the classes.
- **Ease of Testing**: Includes a `unittest`-based test suite for validating functionality.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd plp_academy-python_assignment_week_5
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   Execute the `vehicles.py` file to see the polymorphism in action:
   ```bash
   python3 vehicles.py
   ```

   ### Expected Output:
   ```
